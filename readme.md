# Stack server setup guide

This guide will walk you through setting up and running a Django web application.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS and Linux:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Database Setup

1. Run migrations to create database schema:

    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

2. (Optional) Create a superuser for accessing the Django admin interface:

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

## Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash
python manage.py runserver <port-number>
```

The application should now be accessible at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Usage

- Access the Django admin interface at [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin) (if you created a superuser).

## Deployment

For deploying the application to a production environment, refer to the [Django Deployment Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/howto/deployment/).
